# Week 2 - Day 2

## Week 2, Day 2: Tuesday, July 18

### Synopsis

Week 2, Day 2 concentrates on ... 

### Outcome goals
* How XML copes with limitations of the tree as a document model
* What’s so bad about work-arounds and relying on application-level semantics?
### Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

______

### 9:00–10:30: XML as a tree / XPATH

#### Topics and activities

* XPath as a way of navigating the tree
* XPath path expressions: axes and node type selectors
* **Hands on:** XPath navigation of [*Hamlet*](hamlet.xml) in \<oXygen/\> 
* **Hands on:** XPath navigation of overlap in [“Ozymandias”](ozymandias.xml)
* What’s so bad about markup semantics, the application layer, and workarounds?
* The [cost of workarounds during processing](overlap_xml.md)

#### Outcome goals

* XML looks like a string (and it’s defined that way in the spec), but it’s really a tree. This requires workarounds not only in the markup, but also in the query.

#### Reading

* [“What can XPath do for me?”](http://dh.obdurodon.org/introduction-xpath.xhtml) (optional)

### 10:30-11:00: Coffee break

### 11:00-12:30: Transcription with markup: LMNL

#### Topics and activities

* XML and LMNL sawtooth syntax only look alike, and LMNL isn’t just XML with overlap
* **Hands on:** Tag [“Ozymandias”](ozymandias.txt) in LMNL
* What is Alexandria?
* Validation of LMNL with Luminescent
* Visualization of LMNL in Alexandria

#### Outcome goals

* Looking at and working with non-XML markup expands our ways of thinking about text, and about the workarounds we need in XML
* How do XML (tree) and LMNL (range) model “what text really is”? 
* Why does it matter as long as the workarounds work?

### 12:30-14:00: Lunch (on your own)

### 14:00-15:30: Models, Computational Pipelines
* [_some text here_]
* Gothenburg Model (GM) as an illustration of a computational pipeline

#### Outcome goals
