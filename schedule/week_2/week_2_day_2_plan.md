# Daily plan: Week 2, Day 2 (Tuesday)

## Week 2: Philcamp: Digital philology, creating a digital edition

### Day 2: Transcription, tokenization, and normalization

Manuscript materials must be digitized as character data for subsequent computational processing as text. Transcription, tokenization, and normalization are foundational issues in philology independently of computation, but the digital environment entails additional assumptions and consequences. On Day 2 the instructors will first introduce computer character set conventions (plain vs fancy text, character vs glyph, Unicode, etc.). They will then guide the participants through the division of continuous text into smaller units for subsequent comparison (tokenization), and discuss strategies for letting the research goals of the project guide decisions about normalization. This portion of the Institute will also explore contextual normalization, that is, ways of exploiting textual distinctions for some purposes while ignoring them for others.
