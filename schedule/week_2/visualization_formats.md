# Visualization formats

## Image formats

The web is capable of delivering many types of image files most of which are *raster* images. A raster image is a pixel-by-pixel representation of the visual image. Raster images are easy to create (just copy the pixel pattern), and theyâ€™re the most common way of representing photographs (including manuscript facsimiles), screen shots, and images in general.

## Raster formats

TIFF
JPG
PNG
GIF

## Conversion and the Imagemagick toolkit

The Imagemagick home is <https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>. The tools you need are:

* [identify](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/identify.php): get information about an image (more detailed than the `file` command)
* [convert](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php): change image type and format

Common conversions are not only among basic formats (e.g., PNG vs JPG), but also size (horizontal and vertical pixel counts) and color depth (more colors = better appearance by larger file). To convert a 32-bit PNG to an 8-bit one, for example, a common compromise between quality and file size:

```bash
convert original.png -resize 1024x768 - quality 95 PNG8:new.png
```

This specifies that the image will measure 1024 pixels horizontally by 768 vertically (the 4 x 3 ratio is common), 95% of the quality will be retained (sacrificing a small amount of detail for reduced file size), and the color depth will be 8-bit color (256 different colors).
