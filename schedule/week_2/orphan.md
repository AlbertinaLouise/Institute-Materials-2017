### Challenging Textual Phenomena / Introducing Text as Graph (TAG)

#### Topics and activities 

* Review of Week 2, day 1
	* The digital edition as a computational pipeline
	* Where data modeling belongs in the work flow
	* Markup as an expression of a data model; making the implicit explicit and machine-actionable
	* Model, syntax, and markup semantics
	* How XML copes with limitations of the tree as a document model
	* What’s so bad about work-arounds and relying on application-level semantics?
* Research-driven annotation: 1) What are the inherent properties of the text, and 2) What do I need for my research? Research questions →  data model (including query facilities) →  markup/annotation.
* Introduction to Text as Graph (TAG)
* Modeling overlap and discontinuity in XML, LMNL, and TAG
* Using a schema to bring markup semantics into the model at the application level
* LMNL ranges and TAG sets: similarities and differences: Mrs. Warren’s profession as [plain text](shaw.txt), XML, LMNL, and in TAG

#### Outcome goals

* Fundamentals of TAG: hypergraph
* Modeling discontinuity
* **Community-driven** vs **research-driven** analysis; “how do I do this in X?” vs “how should I model this?”
