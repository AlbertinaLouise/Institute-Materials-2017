# Week 2 - Day 1

## Week 2, Day 1: Monday, July 17

### Synopsis

The first day of Week 2 starts with defining research questions within the framework of project planning. We focus on developing project specifications, and defining goals and non-goals to avoid scope-creep. By investigating  computational and processing pipelines, we take on a modular approach to digital editing. The focus is on modeling textual documents, with attention to alternative models and their syntactic expressions. 

#### Outcome goals

* The digital edition as a computational pipeline
* Where data modeling belongs in the work flow
* Markup as an expression of a data model; making the implicit explicit and machine-actionable
* Model, syntax, and markup semantics
* Successful modeling reduces iterations of the document analysis → schema development → markup pipeline.
* Community-driven (prescriptive) vs research-driven (descriptive) analysis; “how do I do this in X?” vs “how should I model this?”


### Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

### 9:00–10:30: Overview of Week 2 and planning your project

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ----  | ----
20 min | [Overview of Week 2](topics.md) | Presentation
20 min | Explore [project planning questions](project_planning.md) | Discussion
30 min | Apply project planning questions to your own project (individually or collaboratively) | Talk lab
30 min | General discussion of Talk lab results | Discussion

### 10:30–11:00: Coffee break

### 11:00–12:30: Theory of Edition

Are you making an edition of a manuscript or of a text? What is the role of language and orthography in the edition? How will the text be presented? How can the user interact with the view? What will be the role of graphic visualization?

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ----  | ----
20 min | Explore [edition terms and concepts](edition_terms_and_concepts.md) | Discussion
30 min | [It isn’t just words! Explore [visualization as edition](sample_visualizations.md) _NOTE: might move to different day_] | Discussion
20 min | Explore participant data in light of terms and concepts | Talk lab
20 min | General discussion of Talk lab results | Discussion

### 12:30–14:00 Lunch (on your own)

### 14:00-15:30: Model, syntax, and markup semantics

#### Topics and activities

* The digital edition as a computational pipeline
* Model, syntax, and markup semantics
* XML, LMNL (model, sawtooth syntax), GODDAG, TexMECS, TAG. How they're similar and different, and how they only *appear* to be similar and different
* XML is the only framework that is production ready today
*  **[add plain text as model?]**

#### Outcome goals

* How can the elaboration of a digital edition be modularized?
* How are *model*, *syntax*, and *markup semantics* similar and different? 

#### Reading

* **[too much talk? perhaps add exercise from next block]** 

* **[Add rhd/djb Balisage paper]** (optional)

### 15:30-16:00: Coffee / Tea

### 16:00–17:30: Transcription with markup: XML

#### Topics and activities

* Making the implicit explicit with markup
* XML as a tree (OHCO: “ordered hierarchy of content objects”)
* **Hands on:** Tag [“Ozymandias”](ozymandias.txt) in XML (e.g., lines, phrases, sentences, speakers, words, feet, syllables)
* What’s hard in XML: overlap, discontinuity, containment vs dominance, white space tokenization, artificial hierarchy, scope of reference

#### Outcome goals

* How are documents like trees and how are they different?
* What is represented by the model alone (the XML tree), and what requires markup semantics (schema)?

#### Reading

* [“Refining our notion of what text really is: the problem of overlapping hierarchies”](http://cds.library.brown.edu/resources/stg/monographs/ohco.html) (optional)
