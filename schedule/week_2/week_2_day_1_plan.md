# Week 2, Day 1: Monday, July 17

## Synopsis

Scholars create digital editions to serve research purposes that may differ from project to project. The first day of Week 2 begins by exploring the relationship between defining research goals and project planning—which includes an awareness of non-goals to avoid scope-creep. By investigating the preparation of a digital edition in the context of computational and processing pipelines, we encourage a modular perspective on digital editing.

## Outcome goals

* Don’t touch that keyboard! Planning the edition
* Starting with research questions
* Where data modeling belongs in the work flow
* Markup as an expression of a data model; making the implicit explicit and machine-actionable
* The relationships among model, syntax, and markup semantics
* How modeling reduces iterations of the document analysis → schema development → markup pipeline
* Modeling in plain text and in XML

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

## 9:00–10:30: Planning your project

There cannot be a single set of *best practice* recommendations for all digital editions because scholars create editions to meet different research goals, and they do under different working conditions. What’s the purpose of your edition, and what are the resources at your disposal and the constraints on your efforts?

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ----  | ----
20 min | [Overview of Week 2](topics.md) | Presentation
20 min | Explore [project planning questions](project_planning.md) | Discussion
30 min | Apply project planning questions to your own project (individually or collaboratively) | Talk lab
30 min | General discussion of Talk lab results | Discussion

## 10:30–11:00: Coffee break

## 11:00–12:30: Theory of edition

Are you making an edition of a manuscript or of a text? What is the role of language and orthography in your edition? How will the text be presented? How will users interact with the views? What will be the role of graphic visualization?

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ----  | ----
20 min | Explore [edition terms and concepts](edition_terms_and_concepts.md) | Discussion
20 min | It isn’t just words! [Visualization as edition](sample_visualizations.md) | Discussion
30 min | Explore participant data in light of terms and concepts | Talk lab
20 min | General discussion of Talk lab results | Discussion

## 12:30–2:00 Lunch (on your own)

## 2:00-3:30: Model, syntax, and markup semantics

How can the elaboration of a digital edition be modularized? How are *model*, *syntax*, and *markup semantics* similar and different?

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ---- | ----
15 min | Model, syntax, and markup semantics | Presentation
20 min | Plain text as model and expression | Discussion
15 min | XML as model and expression | Discussion
20 min| Other models and their expressions: LMNL, GODDAG, TexMECS, TAG | Presentation
20 min | XML and workarounds | Discussion

## 3:30-4:00: Coffee break

## 4:00–5:30: Transcription with markup: XML

How are documents like trees and how are they different? What is represented by the model alone (the XML tree), and what requires markup semantics (schema)? What’s hard in XML and how do we do it anyway?

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ---- | ----
20 min | Create [your own fork of our Institute GitHub repository](fork.md) | Code lab
15 min | XML as a tree (OHCO: “ordered hierarchy of content objects”) | Discussion
10 min | Making the implicit explicit with markup | Presentation
25 min | Tag [“Ozymandias”](ozymandias.txt) in XML (e.g., lines, sentences, phrases, speakers, words, feet, syllables) | Code lab
20 min | What’s hard in XML: overlap, discontinuity, containment vs dominance, white space tokenization, artificial hierarchy, scope of reference | Discussion
