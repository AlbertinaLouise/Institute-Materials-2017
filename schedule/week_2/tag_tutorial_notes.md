An open question is then how we add markup to it for tokenization for example. 


There are several things we could tell...
One is the model.......
Second is how to get it into the model.
With XML you don't create the tree yourself
Third thing is the query model.

On w3c schools XML is explained using simple syntax examples.
f.e. element trees, root element, parent/child/sibling

The examples on XML are rather oriented on records rather than text.

In text we use mixed content (character elements mixed with elements). This is a special attribute that needs to be enabled in the XML schema.

When we look at poem examples things get more difficult
Often information is hidden in XML attributes

Chapter 20 of the TEI guidelines also is about non hierarchical structures and poems.
