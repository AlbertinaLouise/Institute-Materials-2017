## Week 2, day 1

* “Making *your* edition”: starting with research questions
* Where data modeling belongs in the work flow
* Markup as an expression of the data model; making the implicit explicit and machine-actionable
* The relationships among model, syntax, and markup semantics
* How modeling reduces iterations of the document analysis → schema development → markup pipeline
* Community-driven (prescriptive) vs research-driven (descriptive) analysis; “how do I do this in X?” vs “how should I model this?”
* Modular development: the digital edition as a computational pipeline
