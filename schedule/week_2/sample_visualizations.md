## Daniel the Prisoner: A virtual florilegium

<http://zatochnik.obdurodon.org/>

There are two main redactions or versions, the twelfth-century _Slovo Daniila Zatočnika_ (“Word of Daniel the Prisoner”) and the thirteenth-century _Molenie Daniila Zatočnika_ (“Supplication of Daniel the Prisoner”). Though the textual core of both texts consists largely of the same material, the two redactions (and even manuscripts within the redactions) differ significantly in their use and arrangement of this material. Either one could have been compiled from the other. Indeed it may be said that the “Daniel” texts, like other florilegia, defeat traditional textual criticism: while the _Slovo_ may reflect an earlier arrangement of textual material, the _Molenie_ may be primary at the micro-level, in places more closely reflecting its sources than the Slovo. For a guide to interacting with the interface, navigate to the [about page](http://zatochnik.obdurodon.org/about.html) and scroll down to the annotated screen capture.

## Digenis Akritis: Lay of the Emir

<http://digenis.obdurodon.org/emir.xhtml>

The seventeenth-century Slavonic text has been reordered to model a hypothetical fourteenth-century Slavonic source that stands closer to the reconstructed Greek _common core_ of the tradition. In the full view, the Greek structure is on the bottom row, the reconstructed fourteenth-century Slavonic in the middle, and the extant seventeenth-century Slavonic at the top. Circled sections of the Greek were not continued in the Slavonic; other Greek sections are divided because their parts, which are adjacent in the fourteenth-century, were separated or otherwise rearranged by the seventeenth century. The flyout menu (upper right) toggles between Slavonic and English, and also toggles the visibility of the Greek and the seventeenth-century Slavonic (the fourteenth-century text, the focus of the edition, is always visible). An [about page](http://digenis.obdurodon.org/emir_about.xhtml) explaining the rationale of the edition is also accessible from the menu.

## The story of Mary, Abraham’s niece

<http://bdinski.obdurodon.org/tmp/mockup-abraham-2.xhtml>

Mockup of a reading view that coordinates Slavonic, Greek, and English texts with an interlinear collation of the Slavonic witnesses. Only Unit 3 is active. Clicking on a Slavonic verse in the upper left highlights the Greek and English to the right and loads the manuscript variants for that verse below. In the gray bar to the right of the lower pane, the D/N radio button toggles between diplomatic and normalized transcriptions, and the checkboxes toggle the visibility of individual witnesses. Clicking on the witness siglum to the right goes to a facing diplomatic transcription and photographic facsimile of the page (currently implemented only for BdSb). Dolor coding has been added manually to highlight important moments; the specific colors are not meaningful.

## Russian verse

<http://poetry.obdurodon.org>

Select a poem from the samples listed in the lower half of the main page. Stressed vowels (not strong metrical positions) are red. In Meter column, X = stressed and O = unstressed (again, not strong and weak). The pipe represents a foot boundary and the double pipe (where relevant) a caesura. Parentheses indicate hypermetrical syllables. Rhyme is masculine (lowercase), feminine (uppercase), or dactylic (uppercase followed by prime). Stressed vowels are color coded to make patterns easier to discern. The line graph shows the percentage of time a particular syllabic position in a line is stressed over the course of the poem.
