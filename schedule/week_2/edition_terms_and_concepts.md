## The traditional shape of the edition

* Editions of manuscripts (e.g., [Shelley-Godwin Archive](http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/sc/oxford/frankenstein/volume/i/#/p2))
	* Facsimile (image)
	* Diplomatic (transcription)
* Critical editions of texts
	* Interlinear collation (e.g., [Rus′ primary chronicle](http://pvl.obdurodon.org/browser.xhtml))
	* Copy text with notes (e.g., [St. Patrick’s *Confessio*](http://www.confessio.ie/etexts/confessio_latin#02))
		* “Best witness” ~ dynamic critical text
		* _Apparatus fontium et locorum parallelorum_ “contains references to those texts that served as source for the edited text—this includes also the Bible—and to texts that cannot have been used as a source, but which show a close parallel to the edited text.” (_CCSG_ 8)
		* _Traditio textus_: “sigla of the manuscripts on which the edition is based are repeated on each page of the edition.” (_CCSG_ 10)
		* _Apparatus criticus_
			* Positive ~ negative
			* Complete ~ significant variants (~ orthographic variants)
		* _Comparative apparatus_: “If a text survives in different recensions, one of the recensions produces the edited text and it can be decided to give the differences with the other recensions in a _Fassungsapparat_. A similar apparatus can also be included in the case of florilegia, to compare the excerpts with their respective source text.” (_CCSG_ 11)
		* _Indirect tradition_: “If a substantial and important indirect tradition of the edited text exists, it may be decided to include the differences between the indirect tradition and the edited text in a separate apparatus.” (_CCSG_ 11)
	* Challenges: legibility, completeness
