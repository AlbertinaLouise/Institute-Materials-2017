# Week 2, Day 3: Wednesday, July 19

## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 3 expands upon the idea of digital editions as text processing pipelines. After a short recap of day 2, we continue with the step normalization. We will show how these two pipeline stages prepare texts for automated collation. The process of automated collation is also discussed from a modeling perspective (GM). Participants learn that their research goals and questions influence the computational pipelines.

## Outcome goals

* Understanding the principles of basic text transformations like normalization and how they serve different objectives
* Bringing together tokenization and normalization as individual pipeline steps and seeing how they can be implemented in the act of collation
* Normalize, tokenize, and collate text
* Fundamentals of TAG: hypergraph
* Modeling discontinuity

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

## 9:00–10:30: Normalization

### Topics and activities
* Short recap of Day 2: computational pipelines / modeling / processing / tokenization
* Basic normalization
	* Plain text normalization: lower/upper casing, whitespace, UniCode, punctuation etc.
	* NLTK
	* Regular expressions
	* Basic XML normalization: transforming XML to a stream of normalized (word) tokens
* **Hands-on exercise: [NLTK; regular expressions]**

## 10:30–11:00: Coffee break

## 11:00–12:30: Collation

### Topics and Activities
* Modeling and collation
* Collation within editorial theory
* Alignment (after tokenization/normalization in the GM)
* Collation practice 
	* plain text
	* creating witnesses
	* variant graph as a model
	* visualization of collation output
* Tokenization and normalization for collation purposes
