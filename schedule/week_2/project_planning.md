# Projecting planning

## Overview 

* Types of projects: digital textual editions
* Prerequisites: research questions
* Outcome: goals and non-goals (avoiding *scope creep*)
* Logistics: coordinating team members and resources
* The scholarship of editions: data, interpretation, presentation

## General: before you begin

Outcome goals? Target audiences (*personae*)? Time and human resource constraints? Technical (e.g., format) or management (e.g., license, privacy) requirements imposed by funding agency or matrix project?

## Data resources

What are the data (or *capta*) and how will they be acquired or prepared?

## Parameters and models

Core technology (e.g., RDBMS, XML, plain text, etc.)? Balancing innovation and conformance: itâ€™s your research, but scholars participate in communities.

## Toolkit

Available and appropriate tools and contexts for acquisition, processing, analysis, and publication.

## Persistence, interoperability, extensibility

Integration with other projects? Planning for future growth? Data management or sustainability plan (required by funding agency)?

## Encyclopedic information

Metadata, bibliography, prosopography (*personography*), gazetteer (*placeography*), etc. Master lists for an entire project, or separates ones for (or within) individual documents? Project-specific or third-party? Reference system? Synchronization within and outside your edition?
