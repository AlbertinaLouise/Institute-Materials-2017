# Projecting planning

## Overview 

* Types of projects: digital textual editions
* Prerequisites: research questions
* Outcome: goals and non-goals (avoiding *scope creep*)
* Logistics: coordinating team members and resources
* The scholarship of editions: data, interpretation, presentation

## General: before you begin

### Start from the outcome and work backward

#### Don’t confuse what with how

Outcome goals? Target audiences (*personae*)? 

* **Example:** Instead of thinking that you need a database, think about what the database is supposed to do.

#### Don’t start with specialist consultants

* **Example:** Specialist consultants may think in terms of their specializations, and may recommend specific ways of doing things. Start with the research goals you want to accomplish.

#### Consider the balance between innovation and conformance

* It’s your research, but scholarship happens in communities.

## Data resources

What are the data (or *capta*) and how will they be acquired or prepared?

## Human resources

Time and human resource constraints? Technical (e.g., format) or management (e.g., license, privacy) requirements imposed by research context (funding agency, institutional policy, matrix project)?

## Toolkit

* Available and appropriate tools and contexts for acquisition, processing, analysis, and publication.
* Core technologies (e.g., RDBMS, XML, plain text, etc.)? 

## Persistence, interoperability, extensibility

* Integration with other projects? Planning for future growth? Data management or sustainability plan (required by funding agency)?
* **Example:** Linked Open Data (LOD) is meant for interoperation, and it takes your stand-alone project into a community.

## Encyclopedic information

Metadata, bibliography, prosopography (*personography*), gazetteer (*placeography*), etc. Master lists for an entire project, or separates ones for (or within) individual documents? Project-specific or third-party? Reference system? Synchronization within and outside your edition?
