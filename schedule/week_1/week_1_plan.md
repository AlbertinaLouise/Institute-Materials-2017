# Weekly plan: Week 1

## Week 1: Bootcamp: Computational groundwork skills

Week 1 is dedicated to building up background knowledge of the computing environment that the participants need to bring to the workshop. The main topical areas are:

- Working with files, programs, and the command line
- Regular expressions and operating system conventions
- Understanding programming and naming conventions
- Understanding how the Internet works
- Don’t panic: documentation and error messages
- Python clinic: applying Python programming skills in a coding project (New -- not included in the [original proposal](topics.md))
- Git and Github for collaborative code development (Also new)

### Class Schedule
Rather than covering one topic per day as [originally planned](topics.md), Tara Andrews and Na-Rae Han, two leads for this week's curriculum, recommend that topics be broken up over the course of multiple days. In addition, the last session of the day will not introduce new material, and will instead be used for reviewing or applying the content learned earlier in the day. The “documentation and error messages” topic could be folded into them. A preliminary schedule thus far:

Time/Day	| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday
--- | ------ | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------
9:00–10:30 | Getting to know your OS: file and directory system | Regular expressions 1 | Regular expressions 2 | How Internet Works 1 | How Internet Works 2
10:30–11:00|Coffee break|Coffee break|Coffee break|Coffee break|Coffee break
11:00–12:30 | Command line 1 | Command line 2 | Command line 3 | Git 1 | Git 2 
12:30–2:00|Lunch|Lunch|Lunch|Lunch|Lunch
2:00–3:30 | Programs and files 1 | Programs and files 2 | -- | Python clinic 1 | Python clinic 2
3:30–4:00|Coffee break|Coffee break|Coffee break|Coffee break|Coffee break
4:00–5:30 | Review (Documentation and error messages) | Review | -- | Review | --

Note: It may be a good idea to split 1st day's 3 sessions into OS-specific subgroups -- a Windows group and a Mac group (including Linux folks). That way, people will learn to get around in their respective OS's comfortably before the two groups merge into one. 

### Instructor Assignment
- Tara L. Andrews (?)
- David J. Birnbaum (?)
- Ronald Haentjens Dekker (?)
- Na-Rae Han (Python clinic 1 & 2, ?)
- Leif-Jöran Olsson (?)

There are 17 sections including Reviews, 20 if offering separate Windows and Mac tracks for the 1st day's 3 topics. Each instructor teaching four sections will provide enough coverage. Perhaps each section should be headlined by a LEAD instructor and assisted by a SECONDARY instructor (at the minimum; more could be recruited as needed).
