# Week 1, Day 4: Thursday, July 13

## Synopsis

Day 4 begins with an introduction to how the internet works, as we will build on those technologies in later sessions.  Version management system Git follows.  All institute materials are hosted on Git, so it will seem familiar.  However, Git is also a powerful tool for collaborative coding projects.  Finally, another Python clinic on corpus processing, along with a bit of review, closes out the day.  

## Outcome goals
* [Internet goals here]
* Why is a version control system useful?
* Cloning a repo
* Git workflow
* Become comfortable with command line Git
* Review single text processing
* Process text corpora with Python

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups
