# The command line

## Getting started

Windows, Mac, and Linux all come with command line interfaces:

* For Mac OS X: the **Terminal.app** that you will find in the Applications → Utilities folder. (Many Mac users prefer the third-party <https://www.iterm2.com/>.)
* For Windows: **Windows Powershell**, which you can find from the search box. (Some versions of Windows 10 offer **bash**. See <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about>.)
* For Ubuntu Desktop (Unity): you can type Ctrl-Alt-T or you can type **Terminal** (without the quotation marks) into the Search box.
