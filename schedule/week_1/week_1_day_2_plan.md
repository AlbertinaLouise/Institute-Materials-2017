# Week 1, Day 2: Tuesday, July 11

## Synopsis

Scholars further develop their background knowledge of the computing environment. The second day of Week 1 starts off with an introduction to regular expressions. From there, we build upon the first day's overview of the command line and expand upon our understanding of programs and files. 

## Outcome goals

* Ability to interpret and produce regular expressions for simple textual search patterns
* Editing within the command line interface
* Reading from and writing to files
* Data workflow in the shell
* Familiarity with conventions of your own operating system

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups
