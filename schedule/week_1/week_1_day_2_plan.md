# Week 1, Day 2: Tuesday, July 11

## Synopsis

Scholars further develop their background knowledge of the computing environment. The second day of Week 1 starts off with an introduction to regular expressions. From there, we build upon the first day's overview of the command line and expand upon our understanding of programs and files, beginning to think about variables and data pipelines.  

## Outcome goals

* Ability to interpret and produce regular expressions for simple textual search patterns
* Editing within the command line interface
* Reading from and writing to files
* Data workflow in the shell
* Familiarity with conventions of your own operating system

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

## 9:00–10:30: Regular expressions 1

What are regular expressions, and how can they improve our pattern-matching when dealing with an abundance of textual data?

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ----  | ----
15 min | Review of [previous day](week_1_day_1_plan.md) | Discussion
15 min | Why use [regular expressions](regex1.md) | Presentation
20 min | Creating search patterns | Code lab


## 10:30–11:00: Coffee break

## 11:00–12:30: Command line 2

Now that we are familiar with the shell, we can edit within it and incorporate variables and quotes. In breakout groups, we will practice reading from and writing to files and sending data through pipelines.

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ----  | ----
25 min | Editing and history with [command line](command2.md) | Presentation
25 min | File and data handling | Code lab
20 min | Variables and quotes in the shell | Code lab
20 min | Even more `ls` switches | Code lab

## 12:30–2:00 Lunch (on your own)

## 2:00-3:30: Programs and files 2

We have a basic grasp of directory navigation, but what don't we know about `$PATH`? How does our environment affect our file processing? How can we use commands and variables to manipulate files more efficiently? 

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ----  | ----
15 min | File formats | Presentation
25 min | The environment and `$PATH` | Presentation
20 min | How to find commands and files | Code lab
20 min | Repeating things and variables | Code lab
10 min | Miscellaneous commands | Presentation


## 3:30-4:00: Coffee break

## 4:00–5:30: Review

A recap of regular expressions, working in the command line, and file manipulation. What topics would benefit from additional clarifcation? What are you confused about? What would you like to know more about?

## Homework

We’ll end each day with a request for feedback, based on a general version of the day’s outcome goals, and we’ll try to adapt on the fly to your responses. Please complete [Week 2, Day 1 feedback](week_2_day_1_feedback.md) (just copy and paste it into a plain-text document) and email your response to Kaylen at [kaylensanders@pitt.edu](mailto:kaylensanders@pitt.edu) with the subject heading “Week 2, Day 1 feedback”.

## Readings (optional)

The following readings are mentioned in the individual activities for this day.
