# Week 2, Day 1: Monday, July 17

Scholars create digital editions to serve research purposes that may differ from project to project. The first day of Week 2 begins by exploring the role in project planning of defining research goals (which includes defining *non-goals* in order to avoid *scope-creep*). From planning and research questions we move to modeling and structuring the digital edition workflow as a computational pipeline, encouraging a modular perspective on digital editing.

## 9:00–10:30: Planning your project

There cannot be a single set of *best practice* recommendations for all digital editions because scholars create editions to meet different research goals, and they do that under different working conditions. What’s the purpose of your edition, and what are the resources at your disposal and the constraints on your efforts?

## 10:30–11:00: Coffee break

## 11:00–12:30: Model, syntax, and markup semantics

How can the elaboration of a digital edition be modularized? How are *model*, *syntax*, and *markup semantics* similar and different?

20 min | Explore model, syntax, and markup semantics | Presentation
25 min | Explore plain text as model and expression | Discussion

## 12:30–2:00: Lunch

## 2:00–3:30: Transcription with markup: XML

How are documents like trees and how are they different? What is represented by the model alone (the XML tree), and what requires markup semantics (schema)? What’s hard in XML and how do we do it anyway?
