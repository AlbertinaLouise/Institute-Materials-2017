## Digital edition projects

During weeks 2 and 3, Institute participate will explore and critique exemplary digital edition projects, including some of the following:

* Faust edition (<http://beta.faustedition.net/>). This edition uses range-based text repository software combined with a graph database. The material is transcribed using multiple XML files per unit, where each XML file contains a separate hierarchy; within the text repository the different hierarchies are combined in a multi-layered view of the text. Source: <https://github.com/faustedition/faust-app/tree/master/faust/src/main/java/de/faustedition/graph>.
* Münster New Testament project by the INTF (<http://egora.uni-muenster.de/intf/projekte/projekte_en.shtml>) poses special challenges to automated collation because of the unusually large number of witnesses involved in textual criticism of the New Testament. Because of copyright limitations not all of the results of INTF research are freely available on their Web site, but the Institute instructors have collaborated on INTF projects and will supplement published INTF reports about the workflow with behind-the-scenes guides.
* Petrus Plaoul (<http://petrusplaoul.org>). TEI XML transcription of Peter Plaoul’s Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard. The transcribed pages (e.g., <http://petrusplaoul.org/text/textdisplay.php?fs=lectio1>) provide mouse-over and menu interfaces.
* Samuel Beckett project (<http://www.beckettarchive.org/>) contains TEI XML editions of Samuel Beckett’s manuscripts. It uses Apache Cocoon, a publishing framework build on XMLtechnologies, and extends the digital edition paradigm by modeling genetic editions that capture the incremental process by which the manuscripts evolved.
* Shebanq project (<https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/>). This edition of the Hebrew Bibl, which won a prize from CLARIN-NL, uses a custom made text database (using a graph-like structure) and text query language (MQL). Documentation: <https://shebanq.ancientdata.org/shebanq/static/docs/featuredoc/texts/welcome.html>.
* Shelley Godwin Archive (<http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/>) makes available TEI-encoded genetic editions of the manuscripts of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft. The reading interface provides unusual and illuminating control of the visualization of how different persons contributed text and annotations to the eventual manuscript page.
* St. Patrick‘s Confession (<http://www.confessio.ie/about/hyperstack>) goes a long way toward providing an integrated perspective on scholarly editing and digital technology/methodology.
* Thomas Gray Archive (<http://www.thomasgray.org/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=elcc#panel_ana>). The metrical and other structures underlying poetic texts constitute an annotation layer that may be difficult to integrate into a textual publication. This edition is enriched with a computationally facilitated analysis of the text, with richer commentary exposed in the notes and queries.
* Van Gogh Letters (<http://vangoghletters.org/vg/>) offer a subtle but powerful navigational platform for exploring Van Gogh’s correspondence, and can serve as an example of how developer perspectives and user affordances can be combined to support user-directed exploration.
* Welscher Gast digital project (<http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/wgd/>) is impressive for its linking of text to iconography in illustrations.
