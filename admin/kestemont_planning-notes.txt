Jupyter Notebook
Prepared Notebooks with commented code already present
Exercises are to modify code that's already there

Three mornings (jet lag!)

Day 1: Bag of words, text processing, text as tables, query the tables
Day 2: Unsupervised learning, cluster analysis, PCA, paleographic analysis
Day 3: Supervised learning, classification problems (authenticity critique)

Provide intuition of how it works, e.g., in cluster analysis, how to calculate distance.
