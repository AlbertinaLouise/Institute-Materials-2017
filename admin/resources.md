Synopsis:“The Virtual Manuscript Room Collaborative Research Environment (VMR CRE) brings community and a toolbox of powerful research components to support all stages of research and production of a digital edition. Beginning with the popular open-source portal, Liferay, the VMR CRE integrates 30 DH components to naturally support: Cataloging witnesses; managing and displaying images; producing well-formed TEI transcriptions using a web-based WYSIWYM editor and storing those transcriptions to a versioned transcription repository; community volunteer task assignment and project management; automatic realtime collation of witnesses; regularization and apparatus editing; online publishing of the final results-- as a traditional apparatus, or with interactive tools which let users choose different ways to visualize the data produced in the edition.” (<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUFWN5R6_sLaMj2Qc7Se2_Dkpgfr6jjFDWThKqyeoeo/edit?usp=sharing>)
