# Conventions, typographic and otherwise

## General typography

Except where specified otherwise below, follow the typographic and other formatting conventions at <http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000969/ch03.html>.

## Additions to O’Reilly typographic guidelines

### Menu items or links to click

An inline text link or the textual label of a menu item to be clicked by the user should be surrounded by curly double quotation marks. Example:

Click on the link to “REST Acceptance Tests” in the footer. 

### Apostrophes and quotation marks

Apostrophes and quotation marks _in narrative text_ should be _curly_ (_typographic_) ones, and not straight. To enter opening and closing curly _double_ quotation marks in Mac OS, type Opt+[ for opening and Opt+Shift+[ for closing. To enter opening and closing curly _single_ quotation marks in Mac OS, type **`Opt+]`** for opening and **`Opt+Shift+]`** for closing. Example:

Hamlet said, “Hello, world!”

Strings as data objects should be enclosed in double straight quotation marks, and should be wrapped in backticks like any other text to be typed by the user into a program. Example:

To print the string `"Hello, world"` in Python …

Glosses (translations, interpretations) should be enclosed in single curly quotation marks. Example:

… the use of the **`*`** character to mean ‘everything’ …

### Lexical details

_White space_ is two words in a nominal position (e.g., “White space should be normalized”) and hyphenated as a modifier (e.g., “White-space normalization is important”). It is never a single word.
