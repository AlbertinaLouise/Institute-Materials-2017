# Housing Details

##Arrival and Check-in
When you arrive on Pitt's campus, you'll proceed to Panther Central, which is located in the lobby of Litchfield Towers.  You can find information and maps in the separate Arrival document about how to get there.  In Towers lobby, someone will be available to provide welcome information, your utilities key, and to show you to Bouquet Gardens.  If your arrival time is delayed, we ask that you please email or call one of the undergraduate assistants, whose information is available in the Arrival document.

##Bouquet Gardens
The address for Bouquet Gardens is 265 Oakland Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.  If you are arriving from outside the U.S., you should list this as your address on all travel documents that require it.  Some details, maps, and photos of the building are available [here](https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drs/bouquet-gardens/).

##Amenities
Each suite has four rooms, two bathrooms, and a shared kitchen.  Participants will share a suite with one other person, so each person has access to their own private bathroom.  There is on-site laundry service, though you will need to load funds onto your utility card in order to use it.  Detergent is not provided.  Each room is equipped with one fitted sheet, one flat sheet, a pillow, and pillow case.  We recommend that you bring your own blanket or comforter, along with additional pillows.  A towel and washcloth will be provided with your other linens.  
Kitchens are equipped with basic amenities, such as refrigerator, stove, oven, and sink.  Plates, cups, mugs, and flatware are not provided, nor are pots or pans.  Should you feel it necessary to bring any such items or small appliances (such as a coffee maker), you are welcome to do so.  The Institute provides for three meals per day at Market Central, which is just a short walk from Bouquet Gardens.
