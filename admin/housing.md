## Arrival and check-in

When you arrive at the University of Pittsburgh campus, you'll proceed to Panther Central, which is located in the lobby of [Litchfield Towers](http://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour/litchfield-towers). You can find information and maps in the separate Arrival document about how to get there. In Towers lobby, someone will be available to provide welcome information and your utility key card, and to show you to [Bouquet Gardens](http://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour/bouquet-gardens), where youâ€™ll be staying. If your arrival time is delayed, please email, text, or call one of the undergraduate assistants, whose contact information will be emailed to you.
## Lodging: Bouquet Gardens

### Location

The address for Bouquet Gardens is [265 Oakland Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213](https://goo.gl/maps/vFyeEFPw2NM2). If you are arriving from outside the U.S., you can list this as your address on any travel documents that require it. Some details, maps, and photos of the building are available [here](https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drs/bouquet-gardens/).

### Amenities

Each suite has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a shared kitchen. Participants will share a suite with one other person, so each person has two rooms and a private bathroom. There are on-site laundry machines, though you will need to load funds onto your utility card in order to use it. Detergent is not provided. Each room is equipped with one fitted sheet, one flat sheet, a pillow, and a pillow case, as well as a towel and a washcloth. We recommend that you bring your own blanket or comforter, along with additional pillows or towels, should you wish.

Kitchens are equipped with a refrigerator, stove, oven, and sink. Plates, cups, mugs, and flatware are not provided, nor are pots or pans. Because the Institute provide a full meal plan (see below), you will not need to do your own cooking, but if you wish to bring any cooking or eating utensils or small appliances (such as a coffee maker), you are welcome to do so. 

## Meals: Market Central

The Institute provides three meals per day at [Market Central](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/dining/locations/marketCentral.php), which is just a [short walk from Bouquet Gardens](https://goo.gl/maps/P3QQiF76McM2).
